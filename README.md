## Error Handling Challenge
In this challenge, we're exploring error handling techniques in Python. Your task is to implement a function called `divide(a, b)` that performs division and handles potential errors.

The function should take in two numbers `a` and `b` and return the division result `a / b` if the division is possible. If the division is not possible due to a zero division error or any other error, the function should handle the error gracefully and display an appropriate error message.

You need to implement the `divide` function using exception handling in Python.
